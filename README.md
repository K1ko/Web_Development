# What is pentesting and how to properly do it?
Penetration testing, or pentesting for short, is the practice of testing a computer system, network, or web application to identify security vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit. When pentesting a website, the goal is to identify vulnerabilities that could be used to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive data, or disrupt the normal functioning of the website.

There are several steps involved in pentesting a website, including:
### 1.
`Reconnaissance: Gather information about the website and its infrastructure, such as the web server software and version, the IP address, and the structure of the URLs.`

### 2.
`Scanning: Use automated tools to scan the website for known vulnerabilities and open ports.`

### 3.
`Vulnerability Analysis: Manually identify vulnerabilities by analyzing the results of the scan and examining the website's source code.`
