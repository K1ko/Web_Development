    <h1>Chickens</h1>
<p>The <b>chicken</b>(Gallus gallus domesticus) is a domesticated junglefowl species, with attributes of wild species such as the grey and the Ceylon junglefowl[1] that are originally from Southeastern Asia. Rooster or cock is a term for an adult male bird, and a younger male may be called a cockerel. A male that has been castrated is a capon. An adult female bird is called a hen and a sexually immature female is called a pullet. Humans now keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and as pets. Traditionally they were also bred for cockfighting, which is still practiced in some places.</p>


<p>
Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origin theories of within South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[3] but the clade found in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originated from the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India, the chicken spread to the Eastern Mediterranean. They appear in Egypt in the mid-15th century BC, with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come from the land between Syria and Shinar, Babylonia, according to the annals of Thutmose III.[4][5][6] They are known in Greece from the 5th century BC.[7][8]

<h2>Terminology</h2>
An adult male is a called a cock or (in the United States) a rooster and an adult female is called a hen.[10][11]

Other terms are:

Biddy: a newly hatched chicken[12][13]
Capon: a castrated or neutered male chicken[a]
Chick: a young chicken[14]
Chook /tʃʊk/: a chicken (Australia/New Zealand, informal)[15]
Cockerel: a young male chicken less than a year old[16]
Dunghill fowl: a chicken with mixed parentage from different domestic varieties.[17]
Pullet: a young female chicken less than a year old.[18] In the poultry industry, a pullet is a sexually immature chicken less than 22 weeks of age.[19]
Yardbird: a chicken (southern United States, dialectal)[20]
Chicken was originally a term only for an immature, or at least young, bird.[when?] In older sources, chicken as a species were typically referred to as common fowl or domestic fowl.[21][page needed][failed verification]

Chicken may also mean a chick (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).[22]
<h2>General biology and habitat</h2>
Chickens are omnivores.[27] In the wild, they often scratch at the soil to search for seeds, insects, and even animals as large as lizards, small snakes,[28] or sometimes young mice.[29]

The average chicken may live for 5–10 years, depending on the breed.[30] The world's oldest known chicken lived 16 years according to Guinness World Records.[31]

Eggs from different breeds
Roosters can usually be differentiated from hens by their striking plumage of long flowing tails and shiny, pointed feathers on their necks ('hackles') and backs ('saddle'), which are typically of brighter, bolder colours than those of females of the same breed. However, in some breeds, such as the Sebright chicken, the rooster has only slightly pointed neck feathers, the same colour as the hen's. The identification can be made by looking at the comb, or eventually from the development of spurs on the male's legs (in a few breeds and in certain hybrids, the male and female chicks may be differentiated by colour). Adult chickens have a fleshy crest on their heads called a comb, or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin either side under their beaks called wattles. Collectively, these and other fleshy protuberances on the head and throat are called caruncles. Both the adult male and female have wattles and combs, but in most breeds these are more prominent in males. A 'muff' or 'beard' is a mutation found in several chicken breeds which causes extra feathering under the chicken's face, giving the appearance of a beard.[32]

Domestic chickens are not capable of long-distance flight, although lighter chickens are generally capable of flying for short distances, such as over fences or into trees (where they would naturally roost). Chickens may occasionally fly briefly to explore their surroundings, but generally do so only to flee perceived danger.
